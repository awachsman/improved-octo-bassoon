          <h3> "Unparalleled!"; "A true Makom Torah!"; "Inspiring!"; "Breathtaking grounds!"; "Menuchas hanefesh!"</h3>
          <p >These are some of the most often heard comments from visitors at Keser Torah Estates, located in Naugatuck CT.
      
      <p>
          Several years ago, the visionary leaders of Yeshivas Ohr Hachaim ,the renowned Yeshiva Gedola of Queens, embarked upon actualizing a long-held dream: to build a gated community that would be distinguished by a symbiotic relationship between home owners and a thriving mesivta and vibrant kollel. 
      </p>
      <p >
          Fast forward to today: Mesivta Yesodei Hatorah’s reputation as a premiere makom Torah has become widespread throughout the United States. Kolel Sifsei Dov has attracted a cadre of outstanding yungerleit who have created a ruach of ameilus baTorah. And new spacious, customized homes on large lots are under construction. Keser Torah Estates is well on its way to become the community of choice for Torah-minded mishpachos.

      <h3 class="yeshivaLeadInText">Mesivta Yesodei Hatorah</h3>
      <img class="yeshivaImage" src="images/mesivtaPano.png" alt="Image of Mesivta Yesodei Torah" >
  
      <!-- <div class="yeshivaText">
      <h3>Mesivta Yesodei Hatorah</h3>
          <p>Mesivta Yesodei Hatorah was established at the invitation of the Waterbury Torah community, to provide a first-rate chinuch for local bachurim. Although the Mesivta was founded just a few years ago, its reputation has achieved widespread recognition, attracting serious and motivated talmidim from across the United States.</p>
        
          <p>The Mesivta is part of the network of yeshivas affiliated with Yeshivas Ohr Hachaim of Queens. According to Harav Doniel Lander, shlita, Rosh Hayeshiva, “we are profoundly proud of the tremendous hatzlacha of Mesivta Yesodei Hatorah. The menahel, Harav Aryeh Reiss, shlita, has successfully infused the Mesivta with the ruach of a premiere out-of-town yeshiva. The Yesodei Hatorah program of in-Shabbosos and nightly seder blend the local and dormitory talmidim together in the common pursuit of ameilus baTorah.”</p>

          <p>It's said that "a picture is worth a thusand words". To get a deeper appreciation of the advantages and breadth of experience provided by the Mesivta, and to hear it from the bochurim and Rebbeim themselves, please take the time to watch the short video at the bottom of this page. </p>

   <!-- div class="yeshivaText">
       <h3>Kollel Sifsei Dov</h3>
          <p>The crowning feature of Keser Torah Estates is Kollel Sifsei Dov, an outstanding group of young talmidei chachamim, headed by the well-known marbitz Torah, Harav Moshe Makovoz, shlita.  Special housing units have been built to house this cadre of young mishpachos. In addition to strengthening the learning of the Beis Medrash, Kollel Sifsei Dov will, B’ezras Hashem, imbue the entire community with the spirit of limud haTorah and avodas Hashem.</p>
