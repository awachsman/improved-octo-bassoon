  <h3 >Today's Olam Hatorah, Boruch Hashem, continues to grow and flourish.</h3></p>
  <p>
       Many options exist when choosing a community. But Kesser Torah Estates offers an exciting alternative that uniquely addresses the underlying concerns and needs of today's families.
    </p>

    <p>
     Situated in the borough of Naugatuck, Connecticut, Kesser Torah Estates is just 10 minutes from Waterbury and all of its mosdos and conveniences. Major centers of employment are within commuting distance. A spirit of serenity and majesty characterizes the entire surroundings of this new forty-eight acre, country-like development.</p>

     <p>
      The community itself is self-contained and offers a full range of amenities, including recreational facilities. Large lots are available for purchase and while preferred builders have prepared a menu of <a href="homemodels.html">models</a> at affordable prices, purchasers are free to customize their own home with their builder of choice. To visit the website for a preferred builder, click <a href="https:/www.ableconstruction.com/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

     
      <p>
      The anchor of Kesser Torah Estates is the adjoining yeshiva campus that houses Mesivta Yesodei Hatorah and Kollel Sifsei Dov. The pulsating sounds of limud haTorah that emanate from the Beis Medrash will nurture and uplift the entire community.</p>

      <h3>Leadership at Kesser Torah Estates</h3>
      <p>Rabbi Aryeh Reiss and Rabbi Moshe Makovoz are the anchors at Mesivta Yesodei Hatorah and Kollel Sifsei Dov respectively.</p>
